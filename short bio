My name is Brian A. Aguilar. You can call me by my nickname "Bri" or just Brian.
I am 20 years old and was born on 07/10/1999
My hometown is located at Imus, Cavite, but I mostly stay at Manila.
I am currently studying at the University of Santo Tomas
taking up my undergraduate degree of BS Electronics Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering.

I am very outgoing and happy but an introvert and very shy at the same time. 
There are quite a lot of things that I enjoy like playing games, watching series and movies,
solving math problems and researching interesting things mostly about science.
I took BS ECE because someday, I wanted to become an engineer as well, reach my dreams and become successful one day.
I have started to code a quite recently and I enjoy it for the most part and I'm willing to learn more about it.

Hoping that my programming journey will grow with all the challenges that comes with it. :)
